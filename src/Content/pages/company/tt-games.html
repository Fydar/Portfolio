  <h1>Responcibilities</h1>

  <h2>Server</h2>

  <p>The majority of my work at TT Games was on the servers. I was responcible for the Clans and Leaderboard database and infrastructure, Receipt Validation, Data Delivery, AB Testing, and many other aspects of the servers.</p>

  <p>The server programming introduced me to AspNet Core and MVC, which I utilised on the main game servers and many of the tools that we created to maintain the game.</p>

  <h2>Client</h2>

  <p>On the client I worked on extending Unity's UI (including but not limited too support for the IPhone X notch), various tools to increase productivity (such as automated scene cleanup, configuration and profile management) and restful server communication.</p>

  <p>Many of the server systems I worked on put me in a good position to also do the client code. For Clans I created the UI and for Data Delivery I created a system to manage the flow of network communications in order to facilitate delivered game data.</p>
