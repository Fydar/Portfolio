  <p>I started working with Eneme Entertainment after my first year at Northbrook.</p>

  <h1>Responcibilities</h1>

  <p>I worked on many of the core systems that made up the project <i><a href="/projects/eitr">Eitr</a></i>. Being an RPG game, these included:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Item System</li>
    <li>Inventories</li>
    <li>Skill Trees</li>
    <li>Character Stats</li>
    <li>Buffs and Debuffs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Modularity and Tooling of the item system was very important. I created multiple ways of representing an item on Eitr, however the most successful was a solution I called "Behaviour Graph", which is heavily featured in my personal project RPGCore.</p>

  <p>Behaviour Graph features a fully node-based editor that allowed for advanced customization of items.</p>
