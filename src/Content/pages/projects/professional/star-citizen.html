    <p>I worked in developing and maintaining out-of-engine tooling for asset management and data editing.</p>

    <p>Alongside my feature work, I maintained the companies a pre-existing suite of tooling. This gave me experience maintaining a professional C++ project.</p>

    <p>My tooling and core system programming contributed to the development of both Star Citizen and Squadron 42, as much of the code is shared.</p>
