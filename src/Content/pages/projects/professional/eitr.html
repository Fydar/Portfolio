  <p>An indie-hit 2d pixel-art dungeon crawler.</p>
    
  <p>I worked on many of the core systems that made up the project <i>Eitr</i>. Being an RPG game, these included:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Item System</li>
    <li>Inventories</li>
    <li>Skill Trees</li>
    <li>Character Stats</li>
    <li>Buffs and Debuffs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I was very keen to implement all of these as modular as possible. During my time working on Eitr I developed two iterations of my modular behaviour system.</p>
