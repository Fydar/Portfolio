    <p>An extensive collection of <b>C# libraries</b> for producing RPGCore mechanics and more.</p>
    
    <p>RPGCore started as an in-Unity framework for producing RPGCore games. Nowadays; RPGCore is a collection of .NET Standard libraries that offer specialised sets of features.</p>

    <p>These libraries are unit-tested using the NUnit test framework.</p>

    <h2>Demos</h2>

    <h3>RPGCore.Demo.BoardGame</h3>

    <p>The RPGCore.Demo.BoardGame project is demo project that utilises RPGCore.Behaviour and RPGCore.Packages to produce a game that isn't in the style of an RPG.</p>

    <p>This demo project and be run from the Command Line via RPGCore.Demo.BoardGame.CommandLine and via Unity; however this demo is in it's very realy phases and acts more of a proof-of-concept.</p>

    <h3>RPGCore.Demo.Invetory</h3>

    <p>This demo contains a basic set of nodes that you might expect to find in a typical RPG implementation.</p>

    <p>There isn't much to this demo at this point in time.</p>
    
    <h2>Libraries</h2>

    <h3>RPGCore.Packages</h3>

    <p>RPGCore.Packages is an API for processing and bundling game data. For ever resource managed by RPGCore.Packages, it provides tagging, metadata and dependencies; which work together to form a basic CMS.</p>

    <p>RPGCore.Packages is currently being used to drive the content of my portfolio website.</p>

    <p>RPGCore.Packages also provides a customisable service-stack for importing resources and building resources to packages.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Custom resource importers can tag, write metadata and register dependencies for all resources they import.</li>
        <li>Custom resource exporters can compress, optimize and write new resourcs to the exported directory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>RPGCore.Behaviour</h3>

    <p>RPGCore.Behaviour is a node-based modular behaviour system. It can be used to describe the real-time or restful behaviour of any gameplay element.</p>

    <h4>How it works</h4>

    <p>RPGCore.Behaviour operates on node collections called "graphs".</p>

    <p>Nodes have inputs and outputs that allow nodes to get connected together. Every "connection" from one node to another is represented by a single object that both nodes share a reference too. Output sockets from nodes can write to the connection object whereas input sockets can only read from the connection.</p>

    <p>Nodes can also connect directly to other nodes. This is useful for simpler graph-based solutions like behaviour-trees and state-machines. Nodes can use the Graph APIs to determine which node their inputs and outputs are connected too.</p>

    <h4>Multiplayer</h4>

    <p>RPGCore.Behaviour aims to be fully-serializable and support multiplayer content aswell.</p>

    <p>RPGCore.Behaviour is suitable for the following networked gameplay environments:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Deterministic Simulation with behaviour driven by RPGCore.Behaviour.</li>
        <li>RPGCore.Behaviour driven server-side RPC generation.</li>
        <li>RPGCore.Behaviour driven client input to server-side graphs.</li>
        <li>Server-authoritative inputs to RPGCore.Behaviour nodes on client.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Clean API</h4>

    <p>The biggest goal of mine when it came work creating my own node-based system was to create a transparent API. I wanted to avoid all unnessessary reflection as much as possible to reduce any "black-magic" that users might expect was going-on behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Below is the API for creating an "Adding" node.</p>
