  <p>This portfolio website has been created using ASP.NET Core.</p>

  <h2 id="patio">Patio</h2>

  <p>I created a CSS and JavaScript package called <a href="https://github.com/Fydar/Portfolio/tree/main/src/Patio"><i>'Patio'</i></a> to power my portfolio website.</p>
  
  <p><i>'Patio'</i> initially drew from a lot of the concepts implemented by <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, as I have became familar with Bootstrap during my time working at <a href="/portfolio/lego-star-wars-battles">TT Games</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="progressive-loading">Progressive Loading</h2>

  <p>My portfolio implements pre-compressed and minified images for the purposes of showing low-quality previews whilst the page is loaded.</p>

  <h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

  <p>This portfolio application is hosted in AWS and EC2. The resources are provisioned using CloudFormation templates; one of which can be seen below.</p>
