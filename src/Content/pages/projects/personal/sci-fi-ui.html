    <p>A demonstration of UI tools to create a Sci-Fi UI.</p>

    <p>At the time of this project, Unity's new UI tools where very new. So, to keep ahead of the new technologies, I decided to create a Sci-Fi UI.</p>

    <p>Sci-Fi user-interfaces interest me quite a bit because there is often a lot of small elements working together to convey the narrative of the UI. There are also a lot of passive UI animations that I would have loved to capture in this project; but it's not something that made it into the final product.</p>
