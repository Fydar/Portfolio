  <p>A 2d pixel-art dungeon crawler.</p>

  <p>For myself, the really exciting part of the development of Crypt Crawl was the idea of procedural tilesets. This meant that I could generate unique tilesets for every dungeon in real-time.</p>

  <p>Procedural tilesets were accomplished using Substance Designer. At the time I was very new and I ended up creating an awful, brown tileset. The pixel-art technique that I used later informed art pipeline of <a href="/portfolio/the-dwellers">The Dwellers</a>.</p>
