    <p>A voxel-art RPG game with tile-based dungeons.</p>

    <p>The Dwellers was my final-major-project for my final year studying at Northbrook College. For this project, I worked with the 3D Artist, Nerice, who provided the models and animations for the characters, along with the particle effects for the spells and environments.</p>
 
    <h2>Modular Behaviours</h2>

    <p>Having recently completed the "Phase 2" of my modular behaviour system, I decided that I would like to move onto making a node-based solution for modular behaviours.</p>

    <p>The Dwellers implemented my "Phase 3" node-based modular behaviour system for item behaviours.</p>
