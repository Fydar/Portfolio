    <p>A voxel-art multiplayer PvP game.</p>

    <p>This project was my attempt to create a Cube World style experience with a multiplayer component. The majority of the work that went into this project went into its world authoring and rendering pipeline.</p>

    <h2>The World</h2>

    <p>I started this project with procedurally generated terrain, but I quickly realised I didn't have enough time to make a fully-featured terrain-generator.</p>

    <p>A <i>lot</i> of people ask me: "Hay, Anthony, how did you make such an amazing terrain generator?" And the answer is: I didn't. I cheated!</p>

    <p>The terrain in the screenshots of this project came from a Minecraft world that I created using World Builder and then manually edited in Minecraft. To accomplish this, I implemented Substrate; a C# library for reading and modifying Minecraft world files.</p>
