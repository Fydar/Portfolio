  <p>Fydar.Vox is a collection of libraries for parsing, meshing and rendering voxel models.</p>

  <p>In order to test my library; I made a Blazor application that was capable of rendering voxel art. This allowed me to rapidly iterate on the library and share my progress with others in a portable fashion.</p>

  <p>Eventually, I decided to include the voxel art models on my website. You can see them scattered around my project pages, and I even created voxel art versions of the AWS icons for my <a href="/portfolio/network-programming">network programming skills page</a>.</p>
  
  <h2 id="meshing">Fydar.Vox.Meshing</h2>

  <p>The meshing library is responsible for turning voxel data into a 3d mesh.</p>

  <p>The meshing library offers optimizations for creating performant meshes, at either runtime or design time. Below is a mesh with all hidden faces being culled.</p>

  <p>Another optimization that the library provides is known as "Greedy Meshing". This is the process of combining faces that are immediately adjacent of eachother into a single face.</p>

  <p>For a lot of my voxel artwork, I use <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/">MagicaVoxel</a>. I added support to my voxel library for loading the voxel data directly from .vox files.</p>

  <p>I implemented the library for reading .vox files as a Unity ScriptedImporter; which allowed me to import .vox files directly into a Unity game.</p>
