    <p>A space-based strategy game.</p>

    <p>I really enjoy space games, but I found that they can often be inaccessible. In this project, I wanted to make a 3rd-person experience of piloting a spaceship accessible and fun.</p>
    
    <p>Every ship cannon is individually targeting with unique stats for turning-angle and range. Many of the weapons had unique mechanics to them.</p>

    <p>Missile cannons would fire frenzied-swarms of tracking missiles; torpedo launchers would fire long-range tracking torpedos; mining lasers would continuously mine from an asteroid; and finally the sniper and assult lasers would barrage the target with lasers.</p>
