    <p>A clean and well-polished Asteroids clone (with Discord integration).</p>
    
    <p>This project started as an 8-hour code interview for my position at <a href="/company/tt-games">TT Games</a>, but I found that it was a good playground for testing new programming concepts.</p>

    <h2>Discord Integration</h2>

    <p>One of the first things that I decided to implement to further the development of this project was to implement the Discord SDK. The Discrod SDK provides "rich-presence" integration that allows me to render the players current game state with their friends.</p>

    <p>I also explored the multiplayer APIs that Discord exposes; but I didn't implement them on this project due to it being a single-player game (though I was templted to make it multiplayer purely to explore these multiplayer APIs more).</p>
