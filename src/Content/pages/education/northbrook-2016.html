    <p>I started this course knowing that what I wanted to do was to continue programming; however, the course offered other skills such as 3d modelling which solidified my understanding and offered me a creative outlet.</p>

    <p>During my time on this course, I found Substance Designer, which I used to produce pixel art and other materials in my programming projects.</p>
