  <blockquote>
    <p>I am passionate about programming tools that <b>inspire design</b>.</p>

    <p>I have always been a fan of games where content is delivered regularly with updates; being able to create a tool that could drive content generation kick-started my passion.</p>

  <h3 id="rpgcore-and-node-based-editors">RPGCore and Node-Based Editors</h3>

  <p>RPGCore has always been primarily focused around its modular behaviours; however, creating tools for authoring these modular behaviours is the part of the project that I find the most inspirational.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>I struggled for a long time trying to decide (for the re-write of RPGCore) what the node-based editor should be implemented in. I experimented with <b>Win-Forms</b>, <b>Avalonia</b>, <b>Electron</b>, and other UI frameworks to try and find something that would give me an efficient, cross-platform authoring pipeline. I eventually decided to use Unity's IMGUI, as it was my game engine of choice at the time.</p>

  <h3 id="asset-management">Asset Management</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When rewriting RPGCore outside of Unity I got really into asset management, authoring and packaging pipelines!</p>

  <h3 id="skill-tree-editor">Eitr and the Skill-Tree Editor</h3>

  <p>During my time working on <i>Eitr</i>, I produced a skill-tree editor tool that I found particularly efficient at inspiring design.</p>

  <h2 id="tools-for-live-ops">Tools for Live-Ops and Player Management</h2>

  <p>During my time at <b>TT Games</b> I was introduced to a new type of tooling; tools for interacting with databases and managing the game state.</p>

  <p>Many of the tools I created at TT Games where web-applications.</p>

  <h3 id="web-tools-for-customer-service">Web-Tools for Customer Service</h3>

  <p>At TT Games, one of my responsibilities was creating and maintaining tools that would be used regularly by our Customer Service department. These tools where all web-applications.</p>

  <p>The "Player Admin Tool" was created to allow us to manipulate the profile of players.</p>

  <p>The Player Admin Tool featured authentication which granted developers additional permissions and functionality for debugging and designated "Power-Agents" to manage the permissions of other customer service agents.</p>

  <p>I also produced a "Username Auditing Tool" that allowed stakeholders to perform GDPR-compliant username audits to manually review the profanity filtering.</p>

  <h3 id="web-tools-for-developer-efficiency">Web-Tools for Developer Efficiency</h3>

  <p>I worked directly with developers from all-across the departments in-order to create player management tools to increase their productivity. Being able to manipulate a developers profile in-order to get them into a state where they can efficiently test their features was a very rewarding experience.</p>

  <h3 id="web-tools-for-live-ops">Web-Tools for operating Live-Ops</h3>

  <p>Other web-applications I maintained included tools for server management. These tools maintained mapping players to server environments; managing server lifetime; and direct database interaction.</p>

  <h3 id="documentation-generation">Documentation Generation</h3>

  <p>For AssetIcons, I created a documentation generation solution that utilised ASP.NET Core MVC to generate a single-page documentation file.</p>

  <p>This project utilises Roslyn to perform code analysis and syntax highlighting.</p>

  <h3 id="web-tools-for-content-generation">Web-Tools for Content Generation</h3>

  <p>I have excited by the unique position that web-tools have when it comes to games development and content authoring. I think <i>Dead Cells</i> is a great example of the potential that these tools have.</p>

  <p>Inspired by the web-tool featured in the <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/313026/Art_Design_Deep_Dive_Using_a_3D_pipeline_for_2D_animation_in_Dead_Cells.php">Dead Cells development log</a>, I created my own Blazor application to render voxel models.</p>

  <h3 id="specialised-git-clients">Specialised git clients</h3>

  <p>One of the more useful tools that I created at TT Games was a tool to maintain changes to data via a custom git client. Creating custom git clients can be powerful tools for interacting with the project source and I will always consider them a part of my toolkit when approaching new challenges.</p>

  <h2 id="unity-tooling">Unity-specific Tooling</h2>

  <h3 id="asseticons">AssetIcons</h3>

  <p>AssetIcons is a tool for Unity that draws an icon for ScriptableObjects using their content. This is a very powerful tool for asset management.</p>
