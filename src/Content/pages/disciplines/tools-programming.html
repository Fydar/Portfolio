    <blockquote>
        <p>I am passionate about programming tools that <b>inspire design</b>.</p>

        <p>I have always been a fan of games where content is delivered regularly with updates; being able to create a tool that could drive content generation really kick-started my passion.</p>

    <h3>RPGCore and Node-Based Editors</h3>

    <p>RPGCore has always been primarily focused around it's modular behaviours; however, creating tools for authoring these modular behaviours is the part of the project that I find the most inspirational.</p>

    <p>I struggled for a long time trying to decide (for the re-write of RPGCore) what the node-based editor should be implemented in. I experimented with <b>Win-Forms</b>, <b>Avalonia</b>, <b>Electron</b>, and other UI frameworks to try and find something that would give me an efficient, cross-platform authoring pipeline. I eventually decided to use Unity's IMGUI, as it was my game engine of choice at the time.</p>

    <h3>Content Management</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>When rewriting RPGCore outside of Unity I got really into content management, authoring and packaging pipelines!</p>

    <h3>Eitr and the Skill-Tree Editor</h3>

    <p>During my time working on <i>Eitr</i>, I produced a skill-tree editor tool that I found perticularly efficient at inspiring design.</p>

    <h2 id="tools-for-live-ops">Tools for Live-Ops and Player Management</h2>

    <p>During my time at <b>TT Games</b> I was introduced to a new type of tooling; tools for interacting with databases and managing the game state.</p>

    <p>Many of the tools I created at TT Games where web-applications.</p>

    <h3>Customer Service Tooling</h3>

    <p>At TT Games, one of my responcibilities was creating and maintaining tools that would be used regularly by our Customer Service department. These tools where all web-applications.</p>

    <p>The "Player Admin Tool" was created to allow us to manipulate the profile of players.</p>

    <p>The Player Admin Tool featured authentication which granted developers additional permissions and functionality for debugging; and designated "Power-Agents" to manage the permissions of other customer service agents.</p>

    <p>I also produced a "Username Auditing Tool" that allowed stakeholders to perform GDPR-compliant username audits to manually review the profanity filtering.</p>

    <h3>Developer Efficiency Tooling</h3>

    <p>I worked directly with developers from all-across the departments in-order to create player management tools to increase their productivity. Being able to manipulate a developers profile in-order to get them into a state where they can efficiently test their features was a very rewarding experience.</p>

    <h3>Live-Ops Tooling</h3>

    <p>Other web-applications I maintained included tools for server-management. These tools maintained mapping players to server environments; managing server lifetime; and direct database interaction.</p>
