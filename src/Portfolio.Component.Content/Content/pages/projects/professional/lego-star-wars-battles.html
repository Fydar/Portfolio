  <p>A mobile multiplayer real-time strategy game.</p>

  <h2>Responsibilities</h2>

  <h3>Server</h3>

  <p>The majority of my work at TT Games was on the servers. I was responsible for the Clans and Leaderboard database and infrastructure, Receipt Validation, Data Delivery, AB Testing, and many other aspects of the servers.</p>

  <p>The server programming introduced me to AspNet Core and MVC, which I utilised on the main game servers and many of the tools that we created to maintain the game.</p>

  <h3>Client</h3>

  <p>Extending Unity's UI (including but not limited to support for the IPhone X notch).</p>

  <p><b>Productivity tooling</b> for automated scene cleanup, configuration, profile management, and network debugging communication.</p>

  <p>Many of the server systems I worked on put me in a good position to also do the client-code.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For Clans, I created the first-pass UI.</li>
    <li>For Leaderboards, I maintained and altered many parts of the game UI.</li>
    <li>For Client-data delivery, I implemented the gameplay flow to download game data.</li>
  </ul>
