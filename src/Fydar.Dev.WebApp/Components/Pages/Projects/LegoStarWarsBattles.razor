    <p class="heading-prefix">Servers and infrastructure for</p>
    <h2>Leaderboards</h2>

    <p>I took the role of the <b>Feature Lead</b> to implement weekly leaderboard system. This involved me first provisioning cloud resources and implementing the server systems for leaderboards, and finally implementing a basic UI that can later be reskinned.</p>

    <p>To finish off the Leaderboards feature, I also made an in-browser tool to inspect the state of the Leaderboards and manually modify them using <b>ASP.NET Core</b>.</p>

    <p class="heading-prefix">Servers and infrastructure for</p>
    <h2>Clans</h2>

    <p>I took the role of the <b>Feature Lead</b> to implement the Clans social system. Much like with the <b>Leaderboards</b>, I started by developing the server-side systems and finished with the client-side UI.</p>

    <CutContent>Unfortunately, this feature was cut from the game.</CutContent>
